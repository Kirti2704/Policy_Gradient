Introduction to class of control algorithms in Reinforcement Learning:

This article aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive introduction to one of the most important class of control algorithms in Reinforcement Learning — Policy Gradients. I have discussed these algorithms in progression, arriving at well-known results from the ground up. It is aimed at readers with a reasonable background as for any other topic in Machine Learning. By the end, I hope that you’d be able to attack a vast amount of (if not all) Reinforcement Learning literature.
