introduction to class of control algorithms in Reinforcement Learning
This article aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive introduction to one of the mostimportant class of control algorithms in Reinforcement Learning — Policy Gradients. I willdiscuss these algorithms in progression, arriving at well-known results from the ground up. It isaimed at readers with a reasonable background as for any other topic in Machine Learning. Bythe end, I hope that you’d be able to attack a vast amount of (if not all) ReinforcementLearning literature.
